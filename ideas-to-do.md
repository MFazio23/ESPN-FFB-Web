# Fun Time Auction Fantasy Football

### Ideas/Items to do

- [X] Add 2025 auction values for all eligible players.
    - Make this repeatable for future years.
    - Post on website
- [ ] Add more charts. Charts are pretty.
    - [X] Owner charts
    - [ ] League charts
- [ ] Season by season results
- [ ] Versus owner results
- [ ] Other fun categories?
- [ ] Random facts
    - [ ] Best points+ in a single week (highest score as compared to everyone else)
    - [ ] Best/worst championship game performances
    - [ ] Level of craziness in matchups between two teams
        - For example, Witz and Tim seem to have either close games or blowouts.
        - Is there a way to track variance in scores between two teams?
- [X] Most "perfect" weeks (best ball score == actual score)
- [ ] Owner totals on "versus opposing teams" chart
